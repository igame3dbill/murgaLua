This example was originally intended to demonstrate Fl_Pixmap()
but that particular class is not supported in MurgaLua.
The script still uses embedded image data as would be used
with Fl_Pixmap, but instead of drawing it directly, the data
is saved to a temp file at runtime. The temp file is loaded
back into murgaLua with Fl_XPM_Image().

The toggle button shows how deimage() is used to set an
image to a widget for use in its deactivated state.
