This widget displays the percentage of available widget samples
that have been seen so far in this session.
The actual code used to create the data for this widget is found
at the beginning of the main script (widgets.lua), because it
needs to be updated with each new widget sample displayed.

This data is not exported to the editor window, so this example
will not work as-is from a preview or exported script.
