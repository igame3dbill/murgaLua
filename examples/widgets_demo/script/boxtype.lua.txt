Although there is a kind of order in the table of buttons
in the script, Lua has a habit of making up its own order
of traversing non-numeric tables that, while it probably
has some logic behind it, results in a seemingly random
order in the display of its contents.

The "UP" state of these box types apparently causes a
button to also inherit the "DOWN" state of the same
box type. You can see this when clicking on the example
buttons; the up state will change to down when clicked,
but the buttons already in a down state do not change.

Note that changing the scheme of the demo application will
change the appearance of buttons that are not associated
with a particular theme (FL_THIN_UP_BOX, for example).

Prior to murgaLua version 0.6, there was a bug in some of
the box types. The constant name for some box types was
not fully useable, and required the numerical value.
These same box types also had constant names that began
with an underscore, inconsistent with other FLTK constants.
This bug was also apparent with label types.
Fortunately, this particular script was written in a way
that allowed me to simply add the corrected constant names
to the table without problems, so both 0.6 and earlier
versions can display the box types properly.
