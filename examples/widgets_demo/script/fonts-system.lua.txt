This widget uses Fl:set_fonts() to add all fonts from your system
to the font table and creates a button for each font.

Setting fonts in murgaLua according to what fonts you have on
your system is probably not a good idea for applications that
will be distributed to others, but it can be useful for your
own personal purposes.

The string returned by Fl:get_font(), which here is used
as the label for each button, can be used at any time with
Fl:set_font(Fl_Font_Name,"my_string"), without the need
to load all fonts, assuming you already know what string
you need for a font (you can use this script to do that).

Using a non-Xft version of MurgaLua may initially display
your fonts poorly, since many bitmap fonts do not have a
14-pixel size (the default FLTK font size). The slider is
provided to adjust the font to a useable size.
Also, X provides the xlsfonts and xfontsel commands, which
will give you more precise font strings that can be used
in place of the limited strings provided by Fl:get_font().
For example,
Fl:set_font(13,"-schumacher-clean-medium-r-normal--12-120-75-75-c-60-iso8859-1")
or even
Fl:set_font(fltk.FL_SCREEN,"-*-clean-medium-r-normal--12-*")
will give you much better result than
Fl:set_font(13,"-*-clean-medium-r-normal--*")

The Fl_Scroll + Fl_Pack method of creating a scrolling set
of widgets allows you to add an arbitrary number of widgets
with arbitrary dimensions, without being concerned about
widget placement within the scroll. The widgets will all
be placed neatly one after the other.
The lines commented with "--**" would be used if Fl_Pack
was not used. Note that in the commented lines the buttons
are each placed at specific coordinates, but with Fl_Pack
they are all placed at 0,0
