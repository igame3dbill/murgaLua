 Demonstration of skinned clock widget
 Original code by Marielle Lange (http://www.widged.com)
 Modified by mikshaw for widgets demo package

Much of the code in this sample was written just to handle
the addition of an image to the widget. An unskinned clock
can be created with a single line of code.

The loop was put in place to redraw the widget containing the image.
This is necesary because the clock hands would otherwise draw on top
of the image and eventually obscure the clock face. You can see the
result of this problem by increasing the update interval.
The loop is now also being used to display a text-based clock.
