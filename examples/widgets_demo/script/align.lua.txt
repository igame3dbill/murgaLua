widget:align(integer)
widget:align(fltk.FL_ALIGN_*)

Enumerations:
fltk.FL_ALIGN_CENTER  0
fltk.FL_ALIGN_TOP  1
fltk.FL_ALIGN_BOTTOM  2
fltk.FL_ALIGN_LEFT  4
fltk.FL_ALIGN_TOP_LEFT  5
fltk.FL_ALIGN_BOTTOM_LEFT  6
fltk.FL_ALIGN_RIGHT  8
fltk.FL_ALIGN_TOP_RIGHT  9
fltk.FL_ALIGN_BOTTOM_RIGHT  10
fltk.FL_ALIGN_INSIDE  16
fltk.FL_ALIGN_TEXT_OVER_IMAGE  32
fltk.FL_ALIGN_CLIP  64
fltk.FL_ALIGN_WRAP  128

There are many more options available than those allowed with
the use of constants. In the C++ usage of FLTK, the additional
alignments can be done by mixing the constants together, but
I have not succeeded in doing this with murgaLua.

I don't know if there may be redundant alignments within the
integers listed, or if all alignments are available within this
range, but it did not seem important enough to verify this. I do
know that I went as far as 192 before finding a combination of
wrap and clip, so I thought 256 was a pretty safe range.
