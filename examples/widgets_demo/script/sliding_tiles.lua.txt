This is a demonstration of the classic sliding puzzle game.
Arrange the tiles by moving them one by one into the empty
slot until the image is unscrambled.

This is something I once built with Flash years ago, and have
wanted to do the same with murgaLua for some time. Currently
the positioning of parts of a single image onto separate tiles
is beyond my abilities, so it may require having to create
several individual images for the tiles.
