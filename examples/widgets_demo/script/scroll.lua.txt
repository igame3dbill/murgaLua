The lines creating and displaying an independent window
were disabled for the purpose of including the widget as
part of this widget reference package.

Depending on the context of the scroll (whether or not
there are adjacent groups in the script) a scroll or a
pack may not require Fl_End() or widget:add(), although
it is generally a good idea for the sake of consistency
and to avoid possible future trouble. For example, this
script might work on its own without Fl_End(), but fails
when included in the widget package without Fl_End().
