Each box shows the code used to display a symbol,
followed by the symbol displayed by that code.

The left column displays the built-in symbols.
The right column shows various transformations.

Transforms are added immediately after the "@"
Scaling is done with +[1-9] and -[1-9]
Rotation is done according to numbers on a
numeric keypad. Imagine your symbol is sitting
on the 5 with its right side facing 6. As you
rotate clockwise at 45-degree intervals, the
right side of the symbol will face the keys
3,2,1,4,7,8,9, in that order.

Scaling and transforming can be combined.
Scaling is done first.
@+92-> displays a large arrow pointing down:
  +9 scales the symbol to its largest size
  2 rotates 90 degrees clockwise

$ flips the symbol horizontally
% flips the symbol vertically
@@ displays a literal @
