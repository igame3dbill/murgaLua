X Bitmap images (black and white)

Notice the line below was commented out from the script:
xbm_box:image(fltk:Fl_XBM_Image(demo_images.."xbm_image.xbm"))

The result of this command is essentially the same as the longer
version that was used instead, but it limits what you can do with
the original image data, as there is no named pointer to the image.
In the case of coloring XBM images, as is done in this example,
the pointer is not needed because the bitmap's color is inherited
from the widget's label color. If it were necessary to manipulate
the image data with one or more of the Fl_Image methods, it would
require a pointer: my_image=fltk:Fl_XBM_Image("xbm_image.xbm")
After that, you can use my_image:w(), for example, to return the
width of the XBM image.
