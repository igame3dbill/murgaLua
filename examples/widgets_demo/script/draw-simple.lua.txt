This began as a modification of John Murga's draw4.lua example.

The filled quadrangle will not always be filled. This is a result of
using random placement for its points, which will often result in a
"twisted" polygon. However, it is recommended that polygons always be
convex. At this time I am unsure if it will break on some platforms.

There are many "math.random()" commands included here. This is just
an easy way to create objects of various size, shape, and position
rather than needing to construct a complex formula (which I probably
couldn't create anyway). The specific parameters that are needed for
each drawing function are listed toward the end of the script, and
in the FLTK documentation.
