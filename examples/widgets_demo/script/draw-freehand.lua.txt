This is an extremely basic way to draw freehand lines, with very little
control. The script merely follows the mouse drag and draws a tiny box
100 times per second. I'm sure this could be improved drastically, but
my desire was simply to find a way to create user-controlled dynamic
shapes without making a complex script.
