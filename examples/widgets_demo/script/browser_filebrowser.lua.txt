The Fl_File_Browser class provides very little mouse/keyboard interaction
itself other than scrolling the browser display. Any interaction such as
selection or changing directories must be done through programming.

This widget example was provided only because it's available.
The fl_file_chooser and fl_dir_chooser functions are MUCH easier to use.
I recommend using those functions unless you absolutely must have
the chooser as part of the main window and enjoy punishing yourself.

For Fl_File_Browser and the functions that use it, filetype icons can be
loaded with Fl_File_Icon:load_system_icons()
After that (or instead of), you can specify icons for particular
file types and/or filename extensions:

Fl_File_Icon:load_system_icons()
lua_icon=fltk:Fl_File_Icon("*.lua",1) -- pattern, type (0=any, 1=file/directory)
lua_icon:load(demo_images.."greenguy.xpm")

In the case of this demo, these commands are run from the main script
so that the icon will show in the fl_file_browser example. This feature
is not exported to the editor window.

If you don't load system icons you can still specify individual icons,
but anything that hasn't been specified will be shown with a blank space.
Using "*" for a pattern will apply to everything. It might be useful as
a starting point if you plan to set your own icons for everything.

I was unable to discover how to use a mouse for browser selection.
