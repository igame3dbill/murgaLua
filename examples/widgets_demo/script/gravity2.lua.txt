This is an extension of gravity1.lua
The goal was to try to do the same as gravity1, but increase the pull
as objects get closer to the cursor. Since I don't know mathematics,
I was just pulling equations out of my butt and didn't get it sorted.

But I somehow made something trippy instead, so I thought I'd keep it.
