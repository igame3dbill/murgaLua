Beta 2

This program demonstrates various features of MurgaLua, with
a focus on FLTK widgets (knobs, buttons, etc).

These are mostly very simple examples, and in no way show every
method of creating usable murgaLua scripts. 

The Lua manual was included to provide more detailed documentation.
The FLTK manual wasn't included, since it's provided with MurgaLua.

This program requires at least MurgaLua version 0.5.5
Some features will not be available without version 0.6 or later,
and version 0.6 will eventually be a requirement. I will attempt
to continue support for 0.6 after that point, but that will depend
mainly on future changes in murgaLua and on whether or not anyone
actually continues to use the older releases.

Present support for an external viewer is very basic.
The simplest way to view code with syntax hilighting was to allow
the user to view the code in the text viewer of his choice.
This can be accomplished by pressing the script title button at
top right. The eventual goal is to integrate this more naturally
and to allow the external application to be used as *the* editor.

KNOWN ISSUES

The edit preview feature does not work for the progress widget,
because that particular example uses a table that is kept in the
main script. It is, in my opinion, a minor issue that may just
be ignored for an indefinite time.

The edit window grabs some global variables in order to use them
in a preview or exported script. Many examples do not actually use
these variables, but it was much easier to include them than to
check every example before loading it into the editor.

Title bars do not always display the correct information.

In the spirit of keeping it simple, this application does not
do special checks to insure that edited code remains in a buffer.
If you are making changes to a code sample, those changes will
be lost immediately if you choose to edit another sample.
The editor is not entended as a feature-rich text editor, but as
a simple means to make small changes to widget samples for the
purpose of "just seeing what this thing does".

Testing on Windows has been infrequent and incomplete, although
I have made an effort to stay away from system-specific functions
wherever possible.

The author is an opinionated bastard who often colors his notes
with personal bias. These colorings should not necessarily be
read as recommendations, but more as observations.
