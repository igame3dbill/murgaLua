Changes to the license for the murgaLua compiler
================================================

Even although I don't tell you how to license your own code there are a
couple of things you should know before using the murgaLua compiler.

To fit into the filosofy behind murgaLua you may not encrypt, obfuscate
or otherwise further restrict the accessibility of code compiled within
applications produced by the murgaLua compiler.

The murgaLua compiler is provided as a mechanism to professionally package
and deploy your scripts to certain environments, not as a way to protect
the secrets of how your code works.

Your code will of course remain hidden from the average user, however a
user familiar with the murgaLua environment and it's inner workings will
always be able to de-compile the executable.

Cheers
