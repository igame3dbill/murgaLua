[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [4mfluid[24m  is  an interactive GUI designer for FLTK. When run with no argu-
       ments or with a filename, [4mfluid[24m will display the GUI hierarchy and  any
       windows defined in the file.  Functions, classes, windows, and GUI com-
       ponents can be manipulated as needed.

       When used with the [4m-c[24m option,  [4mfluid[24m  will  create  the  necessary  C++
       header  and  code files in the current directory.  You can override the
       default extensions, filenames, and directories  using  the  [4m-o[24m  and  [4m-h[0m
       options.
