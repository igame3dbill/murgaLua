[1mNAME[0m
       blocks - the fltk block attack! game


[1mSYNOPSIS[0m
       [4mBlocks[24m is a FLTK-based block elimination game. Stacks of colored blocks
       move from right to left as you try to eliminate groups adjacent  blocks
       by  clicking on them. As the game progresses, more colors are added (up
       to a maximum of 7) and the blocks move faster and faster.

[1mGAME PLAY[0m
       Press the N key to start a game. As the blocks move across the  window,
       click  on  groups  of two or more blocks to clear them - the larger the
       number of adjacent blocks, the greater the score.  Clicking on a blocks
       containing a dark ball will clear all blocks of that color, however you
       will score much fewer points than a normal click. The game is over when
       the blocks reach the left side of the window.

       Press the spacebar to pause the game.
