MD5 offers basic cryptographic facilities for Lua 5.1: a hash (digest)
function, a pair crypt/decrypt based on MD5 and CFB, and a pair crypt/decrypt based
on DES with 56-bit keys.

MD5 current version is 1.1.1.

To install on Linux/OSX/BSD, please edit the config file and then call

make
make install

The last step may require root privileges.

Please check the documentation at /doc/us/ for more information.

The DES 56 C library was implemented by Stuart Levy and uses a MIT license too (check the source)
