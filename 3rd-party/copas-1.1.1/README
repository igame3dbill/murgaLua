Copas is a dispatcher based on coroutines that can be used by TCP/IP servers.
It uses LuaSocket as the interface with the TCP/IP stack.

A server registered with Copas should provide a handler for requests
and use Copas socket functions to send the response. Copas loops through
requests and invokes the corresponding handlers. For a full implementation
of a Copas HTTP server you can refer to Xavante as an example.

Copas is free software and uses the same license as Lua 5.

Current version is 1.1.1 and was developed for Lua 5.1.
